# ENG_EK_131
ENG EK 131 is one of the required courses at Boston University for Engineering students, in which we focus on CAD, Arduino, and many other engineering principles.

## Room Temperature Monitor Design
Room Temperature Monitor Design is the final project for ENG EK 131, which covered sketching and dimensional analysis of the structure and the assembly process.
This report is significant as it demonstrated what we gained from the course and allowed us to apply our knowledge to real-life situations.
